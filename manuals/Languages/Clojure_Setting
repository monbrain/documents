### Starting a terminal

For these instructions, you will need to have a terminal, or command line, open. This is a text-based interface to talk to your computer, and you can open it by running Terminal.app, which is found under  `/Applications/Utilities`. If you have never used the terminal before, you may want to spend some time reading up on  [command-line basics](https://macpaw.com/how-to/use-terminal-on-mac).

When you open it, it will look something like this:

![Blank Mac Terminal](https://ericnormand.me/import/blank_terminal.png)

The prompt (where you will type your commands) may look different: it usually shows the computer name and user name, as well as the folder or directory you are currently in.

For the rest of this setup, I will tell you to run commands in your terminal. When I say that, I mean "type the command into the terminal and press the Return key."

### ![java logo](https://ericnormand.me/import/java-logo.svg)Java

I recommend installing Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or newer for new installs.

**1. Verifying if Java is installed**

In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
java -version

```

It may say something like "`-bash: java: command not found`". In that case, Java is not installed on your system, and we will need to install it. If it prompts you to install Java, ignore it and cancel anything it opens.

It may output a few lines saying what Java version is installed, like this:

![Java Version details](https://ericnormand.me/import/java_version.png)

This output indicates  `java version "1.7.8_45"`. In the Java world, we ignore the "1." at the beginning. So that's called Java 7. If you have Java less than 11, you will want to upgrade. If you have Java 11, you are done with the Java step. Move on :)

**2. Installing or upgrading Java**

We need to download JDK 11.

Visit  [adoptopenjdk.net](https://adoptopenjdk.net/). It should look something like this:

![AdoptOpenJDK for Mac](https://ericnormand.me/import/adoptopenjdk-download.png)

Select "OpenJDK 11 (LTS)" under "1. Choose a Version". Make sure "HotSpot" is selected under "2. Choose a JVM". Then click the big blue "Latest release" button.

This will download a pkg file. Open that file to begin installing it. A window should open, like this:

![AdoptOpenJDK for Mac Installer](https://ericnormand.me/import/adoptopenjdk-installer.png)

Proceed through the steps of the installer. You may "trash" the pkg when you're done.

**3. Verify Java again**

Open a new Terminal window.

Run the following command:

```bash
java -version

```

It should indicate you have openjdk version 11 or higher.

You're done with Java!

### ![leiningen logo](https://ericnormand.me/import/leiningen-logo.png)Leiningen

Leiningen is a project tool for Clojure. Most Clojure projects are still built using Leiningen. The projects at PurelyFunctional.tv all use Leiningen.

Leiningen is a command-line tool that is run using the  `lein`  command. We will need to install the  `lein`  command to your path, which means it will be available to you to run whatever directory you are in.

To install  `lein`, execute the following commands in your terminal. You will be prompted to enter your password. If you are having trouble calling  `sudo`  with the message "User is not in sudoers file, incident reported", follow  [these instructions](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/06/add-user-sudoers-file-mac/)  to add give your account  `sudo`  permissions.

**1. Download the  `lein`  script**

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein > lein

```

**2. Move the  `lein`  script to the user programs directory**

```bash
sudo mv lein /usr/local/bin/lein

```

**3. Add execute permissions to the  `lein`  script**

```bash
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/lein

```

**4. Verify your installation**

You should be installed now. Run the following command to test it out.

```bash
lein version

```

It should take a while to run, as it will download some resources it needs the first time. If it completes successfully, you are golden!

### ![clojure logo](https://ericnormand.me/import/Clojure_logo.svg)Clojure Command-Line Interface

The Clojure Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a relatively new (2018) addition to the Clojure tooling world. It is the official way to run Clojure applications. Many people are using it now instead of Leiningen. However, Leiningen is still very popular and all of the courses here on PurelyFunctional.tv still use Leiningen. You won't need it for the courses here, but it is a good idea to install it.

**1. You will need Homebrew**

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)  is a package manager for macOS. It is a common tool for developers to use on Macs.

The Clojure CLI is installed using Homebrew. Type the following command to update the Homebrew package repository.

```bash
brew update

```

If it looks like it ran, you're good to move onto the next step. If the system complains that the  `brew command is not found`, then you will need to  [install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). To do that, execute the following command:

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

```

This will explain what it will do and wait for you to confirm it.

**2. Installing Clojure CLI**

Now that you have Homebrew ready, execute the following:

```bash
brew install clojure/tools/clojure

```

This will install the Clojure CLI.

To upgrade from a previous install:

```bash
brew upgrade clojure/tools/clojure

```

**3. Verifying the installation**

Now that it's all installed, run the following to test it out:

```bash
clj

```

It should start a REPL, which looks like this:

![Clojure REPL on Mac](https://ericnormand.me/import/clojure-repl-mac.png)

If you've got that, then you're ready to roll!

## ![linux logo](https://ericnormand.me/import/Tux-linux-log.png)Linux

This guide will help you install the following software.

-   [![java logo](https://ericnormand.me/import/java-logo.svg)](https://ericnormand.me/guide/how-to-install-clojure#linux-java)[Java](https://ericnormand.me/guide/how-to-install-clojure#linux-java)
-   [![leiningen logo](https://ericnormand.me/import/leiningen-logo.png)](https://ericnormand.me/guide/how-to-install-clojure#linux-leiningen)[Leiningen](https://ericnormand.me/guide/how-to-install-clojure#linux-leiningen)
-   [![clojure logo](https://ericnormand.me/import/Clojure_logo.svg)](https://ericnormand.me/guide/how-to-install-clojure#linux-cli)[Clojure Command-Line Interface](https://ericnormand.me/guide/how-to-install-clojure#linux-cli)

### Starting a terminal

For these instructions, you will need to have a terminal, or command line, open. This is a text-based interface to talk to your computer. In Ubuntu you can open it by clicking "Dash Home" and typing  `Terminal`. You can also open a terminal at any time by pressing  `CTRL-ALT-T`. If you have never used the terminal before, you may want to spend some time reading up on  [command-line basics](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/command-line-for-beginners#0).

It should look something like this:

![Linux Blank Terminal](https://ericnormand.me/import/linux_blank_terminal.png)

The prompt (where you will type your commands) may look different: it usually shows the computer name and user name, as well as the folder or directory you are currently in.

For the rest of this setup, I will tell you to run commands in your terminal. When I say that, I mean "type the command into the terminal and press the Return key."

If you're not using Ubuntu, open your terminal. The commands we type will be the same.

### ![java logo](https://ericnormand.me/import/java-logo.svg)Java

I recommend installing  [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)  Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or newer for new installs.

**1. Verifying if Java is installed**

In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
java -version

```

It may say something like "`-bash: java: command not found`", or it may suggest a package to install. Ignore it. In either case, Java is not installed on your system, and we will need to install it.

It may output a few lines saying what Java version is installed. The first line will indicate the version of Java.

If the version starts with a "1.", then you should drop the "1." and read the number immediately after that. So if it's "1.7.8_45", you should drop the "1." and read that as "Java 7".

It may not have the "1.". For instance, it may say "java version 10.45". In that case, that's Java 10.

We need Java 11, so if the number is less than 11, we need to upgrade. If you have Java 11 or higher, you can move on to  [installing Leiningen](https://ericnormand.me/guide/how-to-install-clojure#linux-leiningen). :)

**2. Installing or upgrading Java**

We have some commands to run in the terminal. These instructions are for Ubuntu and Debian. If you are running another distribution of Linux, follow the instructions  [here](https://adoptopenjdk.net/installation.html?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot#x64_linux-jdk).

1.  Allow extra repositories

```bash
apt-get install -y software-properties-common

```

2.  Get the AdoptOpenJDK GPG Key (for encryption)

```bash
wget -qO - https://adoptopenjdk.jfrog.io/adoptopenjdk/api/gpg/key/public | sudo apt-key add -

```

3.  Add the AdoptOpenJDK repository

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository —yes https://adoptopenjdk.jfrog.io/adoptopenjdk/deb/

```

4.  Update the repository index

```bash
sudo apt-get update

```

5.  Install AdoptOpenJDK 11

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y adoptopenjdk-11-hotspot

```

**3. Verify Java again**

Run the following command in the terminal.

```bash
java -version

```

It should indicate you have openjdk version 11 or higher.

You're done with Java!

To install  `lein`, execute the following commands in your terminal. You will be prompted to enter your password.

**1. Install  `curl`  command**

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y curl

```

**2. Download the  `lein`  script**

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein > lein

```

**3. Move the  `lein`  script to the user programs directory**

```bash
sudo mv lein /usr/local/bin/lein

```

**4. Add execute permissions to the  `lein`  script**

```bash
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/lein

```

**5. Verify your installation**

You should be installed now. Run the following command to test it out.

```bash
lein version

```

It should take a while to run, as it will download some resources it needs the first time. If it completes successfully, you are golden!

You won't need it for the courses here, but it is a good idea to install it.

**1. Install dependencies**

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y bash curl rlwrap

```

**2. Download the install script**

```bash
curl -O https://download.clojure.org/install/linux-install-1.10.2.774.sh

```

**3. Add execute permissions to install script**

```bash
chmod +x linux-install-1.10.2.774.sh

```

**4. Execute the installer**

```bash
sudo ./linux-install-1.10.2.774.sh

```

**5. Verifying the installation**

Now that it's all installed, run the following to test it out:

```bash
clj

```

It should start a REPL, which looks like this:

If you've got that, then you're ready to roll!

## ![windows logo](https://ericnormand.me/import/windows-logo.svg)Windows

This guide will help you install the following software on Windows 10.

-   [![java logo](https://ericnormand.me/import/java-logo.svg)](https://ericnormand.me/guide/how-to-install-clojure#windows-java)[Java](https://ericnormand.me/guide/how-to-install-clojure#windows-java)
-   [![leiningen logo](https://ericnormand.me/import/leiningen-logo.png)](https://ericnormand.me/guide/how-to-install-clojure#windows-leiningen)[Leiningen](https://ericnormand.me/guide/how-to-install-clojure#windows-leiningen)

### Starting a terminal

For these instructions, you will need to have a terminal, or command line, open. This is a text-based interface to talk to your computer. In Windows 10, you can open it by searching for "command prompt" in the search bar then clicking on the Command Prompt app.

![Searching for "command prompt"](https://ericnormand.me/import/searching-for-command-prompt.png)

If you have never used the terminal before, you may want to spend some time reading up on  [command-line basics](http://dosprompt.info/).

It should look something like this:

![Windows Blank Terminal](https://ericnormand.me/import/empty-command-prompt.png)

The prompt (where you will type your commands) may look different: it usually shows the folder you are currently in.

For the rest of this setup, I will tell you to run commands in your terminal. When I say that, I mean "type the command into the terminal and press the Return key."

### ![java logo](https://ericnormand.me/import/java-logo.svg)Java

I recommend installing Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or newer for new installs.

**1. Verifying if Java is installed**

In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
java -version

```

It may say something like "`'java' is not a recognized command'`". If it does, that means Java is not installed and we will need to install it.

It may output a few lines saying what Java version is installed. The first line will indicate the version of Java.

If the version starts with a "1.", then you should drop the "1." and read the number immediately after that. So if it's "1.7.8_45", you should drop the "1." and read that as "Java 7".

It may not have the "1.". For instance, it may say "java version 10.45". In that case, that's Java 10.

We need Java 11, so if the number is less than 11, we need to upgrade. If you have Java 11 or higher, you can move on to  [installing Leiningen](https://ericnormand.me/guide/how-to-install-clojure#windows-leiningen). :)

**2. Installing or upgrading Java**

We need to download JDK 11.

Visit  [adoptopenjdk.net](https://adoptopenjdk.net/). It should look something like this:

![AdoptOpenJDK for Windows](https://ericnormand.me/import/adoptopenjdk-windows.png)

Select "OpenJDK 11 (LTS)" under "1. Choose a Version". Make sure "HotSpot" is selected under "2. Choose a JVM". Then click the big blue "Latest release" button.

This will download a msi file (installer). Open that file to begin installing it. A window should open, like this:

![AdoptOpenJDK for Windows Installer](https://ericnormand.me/import/adoptopenjdk-windows-installer.png)

Proceed through the installer with the defaults.

**3. Verify Java again**

Open a new command prompt, then run the following command:

```bash
java -version

```

It should indicate you have openjdk version 11 or higher.

You're done with Java!

**1. Download the  `lein.bat`  script**

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein.bat

```

**2. Create a  `bin`  directory for scripts**

```bash
md bin

```

**3. Move the  `lein.bat`  script to that directory**

```bash
move lein.bat bin

```

**4. Add  `bin`  to your path**

```bash
setx path "%path%;%USERPROFILE%\bin"

```

**5. Complete your installation**

Close the command prompt and open a new one. Then run the following command to finish the installation.

```bash
lein self-install

```

It should take a while to run, as it will download some resources it needs the first time. If it completes successfully, you are golden!

여기는 제가 개인적으로 Clojure Language를 공부하는 곳입니다. 두서 없이 작성될 수 있으며

설명이 친절하지 않을 수 있습니다. 혹시 궁금한 점이 있으면 댓글로 남겨주세요.

개발환경 세팅 운영체제는 Windows 기준입니다.

## JVM 설치

JVM 1.6 이상을 설치하면 된다고합니다.

저는 “jdk 설치” 설치로 검색하여 아무 블로그나 따라하였습니다.

![Clojure 개발환경 세팅 - JVM 설치](https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bY01q3/btrsY7i3iU2/8NBbCSZ6o8YX6kEz96NCk1/img.png "Clojure 개발환경 세팅 - JVM 설치")

저는 상기의 경로에 설치했습니다.

## Clojure 설치

Clojure는 Lisp의 파생언어(Dialect)이고 JVM 엔진 상에서 구동됩니다. 그래서 상기의 jdk 설치가 필요했던거구요.

Leiningen은 커맨드라인 방식의 Clojure 개발 환경이자 프로젝트 관리툴입니다. 필수라고 보시면 됩니다.

### Leiningen 설치

[leiningen-win-installer](https://djpowell.github.io/leiningen-win-installer/)

Leiningen 설치를 도와주는 installer 다운링크입니다. 윈도우즈의 경우 설치가 맥 OS보다 복잡하므로 인스톨러의 도움을 받는 것이 좋습니다. 윈도우즈가 아닌 운영체제의 경우 Leiningen 설치과정을 소개하는 자료가 많으니 검색으로 찾아보시면 됩니다.

![Clojure 개발환경 세팅 - Clojure 설치 - Leiningen 설치](https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/N8vQv/btrsTb1PdDP/KqQhFVJwin2TT3pIoTAWO1/img.png "Clojure 개발환경 세팅 - Clojure 설치 - Leiningen 설치")

계속 Next 를 눌러줍니다.

### Leiningen 설치 완료 및 확인

설치가 완료되었으면 cmd 창을 열어서 lein 설치를 확인해봅니다.

![Clojure 개발환경 세팅 - Clojure 설치 - Leiningen 설치 완료 및 확인](https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/q6h6q/btrsY7wAsVI/ea0LAa3qJKy14rgDprmqf0/img.png "Clojure 개발환경 세팅 - Clojure 설치 - Leiningen 설치 완료 및 확인")

command 입력창에 lein 을 눌러서 메뉴들이 뜨는지 확인합니다.

## REPL 환경에서 Clojure 코드 실행해보기

![Clojure 개발환경 세팅 - REPL 환경에서 Clojure 코드 실행해보기](https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/b2V90e/btrsYGFP6KR/DKlXV1KW6vw8embC4yrbi1/img.png "Clojure 개발환경 세팅 - REPL 환경에서 Clojure 코드 실행해보기")

lein repl 이라고 입력하면 REPL(Read Eval Print Loop) 환경에서 실행할 수 있습니다. 처음에 코드를 연습해 보기 좋습니다.
